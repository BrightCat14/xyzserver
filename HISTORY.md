# History of the xlibre-xserver fork named **xyzserver**

**Background:** A friend of mine installed Fedora with KDE Plasma running on Wayland, but it was unstable for him. He ended up switching from Wayland back to X11.

That got me thinking — *why not fork xserver myself?*
Since GitLab required spam verification and I didn’t feel like dealing with that, I turned to GitHub instead. There, I found the **xlibre-xserver** project and decided to fork it — and that’s how **xyzserver** was born.
